For this assignment, we were asked to develop and create a
generative piece of work that could contain one of three elements.
Displays a new static content every time the user runs the program,
changes visual condition overtime, or if the program changes according to the
user interactions (mouse or keyboard events).

When the webpage is first displayed to you, you will need
to start the program by pressing one of the arrow buttons
on the keyboard. From this the shape will move across the
screen with a trail following it so you are able to create
different shapes with the object as it moves across the screen.
Whilst the shape is moving across the screen it will rapidly
change colours.
If you want to reset the page and you don't want to have to
move the mouse all of the way up to the top of the webpage
to click the refresh button, you can simply left click
anywhere on the screen and the canvas will automatically
reset and you can start over again.
